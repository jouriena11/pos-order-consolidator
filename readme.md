## **Future Development**

### UX/UI
- to include a proper app logo
- to include menu category filter tabs in frontend POS order page
- to include menu category
- to limit (cooking) batch size
- to incorporate socket.io for real-time notifications between the FOH and the kitchen
- to create a dashboard for different types of user
- to change `Menu` submenus to include just ["Category" and "Menu"] and have the ability to add, update, delete Menu and Menu Category in its own page instead
- to include a role of `super admin` that has a permission to update the status of `admins`

- to include reminder-type notifications (using setTimeout()), i.e. when there's no change in an order/cooking status after a certain period of time, e.g. 5 minutes
- to implement cutoff point for batch cooking, i.e. in real practice, there is a maximum limit to the amount of servings that can be cooked in batch
- to apply pagination and category tabs on POS Order page
- to apply sorting, filtering, and pagination to `User Permissions`, `Kitchen Orders`, 
- consecutive order number (instead of randomly generated by MongoDB)
- to allow associated MenuCategory update from menu document (currently, it's not allowed)

### Analytics
- to include more reports, e.g.
    - average time elapsed from the moment an order's status changes from 'ready' to 'served' -- this helps monitorwhether FOH managers are promptly serving the food or regularly updating the order status.  By identifying any delays, this report can assist in improving customer satisfaction and optimizing restaurant operations.

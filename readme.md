# **Order Consolidator**

## **Project Description**
---
This point-of-sale (POS) web application is designed to manage restaurant orders more efficiently with a unique feature for order consolidation. By consolidating multiple orders into a single batch, the web app enables restaurants to adopt batch cooking, which is generally faster than per-order cooking. This approach can result in significant time savings for restaurant staff, leading to an increase in overall order management efficiency. Order consolidations allow restaurants to streamline their operations, reduce wait times for customers, and ultimately enhance their dining experience. With this innovative approach, restaurant owners can take advantage of the latest technology to optimize their order management processes and gain a competitive edge in the industry.

## **Future Development**
---

### **Global**
- to include a proper app logo in the AppBar
- to incorporate socket.io for real-time notifications between the FOH and the kitchen
- to include a role of `super admin` that has a permission to update the status of `admins`
- to reorganize and clean up codes

<br>

### **Dashboard**
- to create a dashboard for different types of user

<br>

### **POS Order page**
- to implement consecutive order number (instead of using order ID randomly generated by MongoDB)
- to include category tabs
- to implement pagination to accommodate sizable menu collection
- consecutive order number (instead of randomly generated by MongoDB)
- to include discount options (e.g. percentage or absolute discount, total bill discount, and per-item discount)
- to implement GST calculation
- to implement `Stripe` library
- to support post-paid (i.e. pay later) orders
- to support support split billing
- to implement cash change calculation
- to improve mobile responsiveness
- to implement the `pending orders` icon in the AppBar, clicking on it should open a modal that displays only the pending orders (i.e. orders that have not been served yet).
- to implement `notification` icon in the AppBar that displays an unread badge on top of the icon when there is an incoming update from the kitchen, clicking on it should open a modal that displays a list of notification messages

### **Profile**
- to code `Update Profile` and `Change Password` pages

### **Menu / Menu Categories**
- to change `Menu` submenus to include just ["Category" and "Menu"] and have the ability to add, update, delete Menu and Menu Category in its own page instead
- to allow associated MenuCategory update from menu document (currently, it's not allowed)
- to include image upload functionality when adding a new menu (and possibly menu category)

### **Kitchen Orders page**
- to implement cutoff point for batch cooking, i.e. in real practice, there is a maximum limit to the amount of servings that can be cooked in batch
- to include reminder-type notifications (using setTimeout()), i.e. when there's no change in an order/cooking status after a certain period of time, e.g. 5 minutes
- to apply sorting, filtering, and pagination 
- [Bug Fix] order consolidation currently only works when cooking status is "On Queue"

### **Permissions**
- to apply sorting, filtering (e.g. by user role or user status), and pagination 

### **Order Status Report**
- to allow updating customer name
- to implement real-time timer, showing minutes elapsed since an order has been created
- to implement collapse table showing [menu items, qty, and remarks] that belong to each order 

### **Reports/Analytics**
- to include more reports, e.g.
    - average time elapsed from the moment an order's status changes from 'ready' to 'served' -- this helps monitorwhether FOH managers are promptly serving the food or regularly updating the order status.  By identifying any delays, this report can assist in improving customer satisfaction and optimizing restaurant operations.
